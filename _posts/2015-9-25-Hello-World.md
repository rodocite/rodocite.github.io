title: Hello World

Hello world, I'm Rodo, a software engineer from [MakerSquare's](http://www.makersquare.com/) first Los Angeles cohort and this is my technical blog. I thought it would be a great to start one now since I didn't have time during the course. Here's what I have planned:

* Redux - We were advised not to commit to projects during the job hunt (so we can totally just focus on getting jobs), but since my thesis project was built on React, I felt that I should take advantage of that momentum and learn [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) and [Falcor](https://github.com/Netflix/falcor).

* I will continue writing about my experiences at MakerSquare. Before the course, I had a blog detailing my preparation for the technical interview process, but I took it down since I felt it would become a distraction.

* A Google Maps API tutorial. I'll highlight some gotcha's for people starting with the API. I got to know it pretty well since three of my projects at MakerSquare used Google Maps and I provided Google Maps support for other teams.

* My initial impressions about the job market in Los Angeles versus San Francisco, having worked with extremely new technology for my thesis project (React and ES6). You can find the team repo for that project here: https://github.com/team-scrb/artwlk/tree/dev

I have a lot of housekeeping to do during this transition from an 'accelerated software engineering bootcamp' back to normal life. Feel free to [contact me](http://rodocite.github.io/about/) if you're curious about my experience. I know that's something I get a lot of questions about.

It feels great to be done!
