I'm a full stack software engineer from [MakerSquare's](http://www.makersquare.com/) first Los Angeles cohort. In my previous career, I was lead operating engineer for Good Samaritan Hospital's (Los Angeles) plant operations and engineering department. Now, I make apps for a living (and for fun!)

I really like working with Javascript (ES6), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
